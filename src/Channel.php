/**
 * Unbuffered Channels
 *  An unbuffered channel will block on calls to {@see Channel::send()} until there is a reciever, and block on calls to
 *   {@see Channel::recv()} until there is a sender. This means an unbuffered channel is not only a way to share data
 *   among tasks but also a simple method of synchronization.
 *
 *  An unbuffered channel is the fastest way to share data among tasks, requiring the least copying.
 *
 * Buffered Channels
 *  A buffered channel will not block on calls to {@see Channel::send()} until capacity is reached, calls to
 *   {@see Channel::recv()} will block until there is data in the buffer.
 *
 * Closures over Channels
 *  A powerful feature of parallel channels is that they allow the exchange of closures between tasks (and runtimes).
 *
 *  When a closure is sent over a channel the closure is buffered, it doesn't change the buffering of the channel
 *   transmitting the closure, but it does effect the static scope inside the closure: The same closure sent to
 *   different runtimes, or the same runtime, will not share their static scope.
 *
 *  This means that whenever a closure is executed that was transmitted by a channel, static state will be as it was when the closure was buffered.
